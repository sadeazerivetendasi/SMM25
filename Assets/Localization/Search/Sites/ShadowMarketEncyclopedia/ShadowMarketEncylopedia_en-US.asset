    m_Localized: 'Shadow Market was established by an unknown collective of programmers
      believed to be based in Baku, Azerbaijan. The platform emerged during a period
      of rapid technological development in post-Soviet states, taking advantage
      of developing internet infrastructure and regulatory gaps in digital commerce
      oversight.


      The marketplace initially focused on digital goods and services
      but expanded to include a broader range of products as its user base grew.
      By 2003, Shadow Market had attracted vendors from across Europe and Asia, establishing
      itself as a significant competitor to established dark web marketplaces.'
